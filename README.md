# Percentage Calculator 

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that allows users to calculate what percentage one number (X) is of another number (Y). It consists of an HTML webpage with two input fields, a "Calculate" button, and a result display area. The calculation is performed using JavaScript.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The web page provides a straightforward interface for entering the two numbers and obtaining the percentage result.

- Error handling: The application checks if both input fields are filled before performing the calculation and provides an alert if either field is empty.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Enter a numerical value for X in the first input field.

3. Enter a numerical value for Y in the second input field.

4. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate what percentage X is of Y.

5. The calculated result will be displayed below the form in the format "Answer: [calculated percentage]%."

## Project Structure
